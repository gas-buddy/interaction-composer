interaction-composer
====================

A command line tool to build interaction models
(for Alexa for now) based on an intermediate
format that is easier to maintain in source
control and across deployment environments.

Usage
=====
```
npx @gasbuddy/interaction-composer <path to json file>
```

See the [test/model](./test/model) directory for a simple example that illustrates environment aware naming
and intent inclusion.
